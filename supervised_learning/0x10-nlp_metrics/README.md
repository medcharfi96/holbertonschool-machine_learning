# 0x10. Natural Language Processing - Evaluation Metrics

**The BLEU score measures:**
* A model’s precision

**The ROUGE score measures:**
* A model’s precision
* A model’s recall

**The BLEU score was designed for:**
* Machine Translation

**What are the shortcomings of the BLEU score?**
* It cannot judge grammatical accuracy
* It cannot judge meaning
* It does not work with languages that lack word boundaries
* A higher score is not necessarily indicative of a better translation

**Perplexity measures:**
* The branching factor of a prediction

## What is a BLEU score?
BLEU (bilingual evaluation understudy) is an algorithm for evaluating the quality of text which has been machine-translated from one natural language to another. Quality is considered to be the correspondence between a machine's output and that of a human: "the closer a machine translation is to a professional human translation, the better it is" – this is the central idea behind BLEU. BLEU was one of the first metrics to claim a high correlation with human judgements of quality and remains one of the most popular automated and inexpensive metrics.


### What is a ROUGE score?
ROUGE stands for Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation. It is essentially a set of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization of texts as well as machine translations.
It works by comparing an automatically produced summary or translation against a set of reference summaries (typically human-produced). 
### What is perplexity?
In information theory, perplexity is a measurement of how well a probability distribution or probability model predicts a sample. It may be used to compare probability models. A low perplexity indicates the probability distribution is good at predicting the sample.
