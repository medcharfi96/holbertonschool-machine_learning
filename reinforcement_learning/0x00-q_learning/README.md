What is reinforcement learning?
* Its own subcategory of machine learning

What is an environment?
* The place in which actions can be performed


An agent chooses its action based on:
* The current state
The value function
The policy function
The previous reward

What is a policy function?
* A description of how the agent should behave
* A function that is learned

What is a value function?
* A description of how the agent could be rewarded in the future
A function that is learned

What is epsilon-greedy?
* A balance exploration and exploitation

What is Q-learning?
* A reinforcement learning algorithm
A value-based learning algorithm
